Some hints for me, as i often forget certain key combinations

Opening a file in readonly mode
vim -R <fn>    -- hint make an alias v = 'vim -R'
if file already open do :set ro

This allows buffer modification... 
To completely disallow modification :set nomodifiable or :set noma
To allow modification use :set modifiable or :set ma
