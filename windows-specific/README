Windows Specific Config
=======================

The purpose of these two config files, is to solve the following scenario.

A windows machine has the following drives
C:\> and D:\>

The home directory would be typically 
C:\Users\<username>

But if D:\> is where all the data is stored(that is how I keep my machine) and C:\> holds only the OS then
one would want the vimconfig files to be in 
D:\Users\<username>

However, it is possible that this machine is also used at office and the logon script at the office changes the 
home directory to H:\> which might be a shared drive on the office network.

So, now, one would need to keep two sets of vimrc , one on the local drive and the other on the network drive.
vim would load the config files based on the $HOME directory.



Solution
========
The two files _vimrc and _gvimrc can help in solving the scenario.
It checks if the home directory of the user is either
C:\Users\<username> or D:\Users\<username>

If it is, then nothing is done and vim loads the vimrc by default.

However if the home drive is something different from the above 2 mentioned, eg, H:\> etc. then
the provided files check the above 2 mentioned folders for the vimrc and gvimrc files.

And finally tries to execute the vimrc.local and gvimrc.local files.

Eg: If $HOME=H:\> is the home directory 
    and the config files are in D:\Users\user.name then 
    this is how the scripts will get executed.

  D:\Users\user.name\vimfiles\vimrc
  D:\Users\user.name\vimfiles\gvimrc

    (the vimrc and gvimrc have includes inside them to look for $HOME\_vimrc.local and $HOME\_gvimrc.local)
    (this is to make it compatible in a *nix scenario where $HOME is typically the user's home dir on the box)

are executed and then finally

  D:\Users\user.name\_vimrc.local
  D:\Users\user.name\_gvimrc.local

INSTALLATION
============
Copy the two files _vimrc and _gvimrc to the folder where the vim is installed, typically the $VIM folder.

Eg. if vim is installed in 
    C:\bin\vim

    then copy the files to
    C:\bin\vim\_vimrc
    C:\bin\vim\_gvimrc


TIP
===
Just like in *nix, make a link on the windows machine to point to the config files.

Eg. If your home drive is C:\Users\<username>, but you want your config in D:\Users\<username>
    make links to point the files
    C:\Users\<username>\vimfiles -> D:\Users\<username>\vimfiles
    C:\Users\<username>\_vimrc.local -> D:\Users\<username>\_vimrc.local
    C:\Users\<username>\_gvimrc.local -> D:\Users\<username>\_gvimrc.local

Also, the vimfiles directory;  D:\Users\<username>\vimfiles\
  contains the files vimrc.local and gvimrc.local

So links can be made for those files too instead of creating
    D:\Users\<username>\_vimrc.local -> D:\Users\<username>\vimfiles\vimrc.local 
    D:\Users\<username>\_gvimrc.local -> D:\Users\<username>\vimfiles\gvimrc.local 

lookup the mklink command. 
This will work only on Vista and Above on NTFS.
May not work across network drives.
